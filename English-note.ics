 aditionally understood as the ability to read and write.\nThe term's meani
 ng has been expanded to include the ability to use\nlanguage\, numbers\, i
 mages and other means to understand and use the\ndominant symbol systems o
 f a culture. The concept of literacy is\nexpanding in OECD countries to in
 clude skills to access knowledge\nthrough technology and ability to assess
  complex contexts.Literacy\nrepresents the lifelong\, intellectual process
  of gaining meaning from\na critical interpretation of written or printed 
 text. The key to all\nliteracy is reading development\, a progression of s
 kills that begins\nwith the ability to understand spoken words and decode 
 written words\,\nand culminates in the deep understanding of text. Reading
  development\ninvolves a range of complex language underpinnings including
  awareness\nof speech sounds (phonology)\, spelling patterns (orthography)
 \, word\nmeaning (semantics)\, grammar (syntax) and patterns of word forma
 tion\n(morphology)\, all of which provide a necessary platform for reading
 \nfluency and comprehension. Once these skills are acquired\, the reader\n
 can attain full language literacy\, which includes the abilities to\napply
  to printed material critical analysis\, inference and synthesis\;\nto wri
 te with accuracy and coherence\; and to use information and\ninsights from
  text as the basis for informed decisions and creative\nthought. The inabi
 lity to do so is called illiteracy or\nanalphabetism.The United Nations Ed
 ucational\, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO) defines literac
 y as the "ability to identify\,\nunderstand\, interpret\, create\, communi
 cate and compute\, using printed\nand written materials associated with va
 rying contexts. Literacy\ninvolves a continuum of learning in enabling ind
 ividuals to achieve\ntheir goals\, to develop their knowledge and potentia
 l\, and to\nparticipate fully in their community and wider society". 来源于：维
