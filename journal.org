**** 感悟
今日读书入胜是什么有了感悟
谁人曾“会当临绝顶，一览众山小”
不曾经历失败，何曾体验成功。
何为俊杰，在常人堆里是常人，在俊杰堆里是常人，自然也。
人贵在胜己，与自己比，勿与他人较。
有人依平台而活，混的如鱼得水，有人放眼世界，默默工作与奉献，眼界不同，境界不同，
十年的结果也不同，如不坚持十年，没有任何效果。
十年还中磨一剑，不要妄求！
静坐窗前读春秋，沉心默默作学问。

**** today clean up office
That was a pleasant surprise!
I feel very pleasant.

Lesson 125

Can't you come in and have tea now, Peter?
Not yet!
I must water the garden first.
Do you have to water it now?
I'm afraid I must.
Look at it!
It's terribly dry.
What a nuisance!
Last summer it was very dry, too.
Don't you remember?
I had to water it every day.
Well, I'll have tea by myself.
That was quick!
Have you finished already?
Yes. Look out of the window.
It's raining!
That means you don't need to water the garden.
That was a pleasant surprise!
Tt means I can have tea, instead.

**** 今日短文
自今日始，把自己书写的文章录入，以便修改，且夫人及吾儿读来顺畅。
   上班后，清扫办公室。机器移位。吾不大上心养之文竹移至眼前。因靠窗放，其为得光
而全歪。最长一枝近一米。由此推，当其得光无望时，直生。给点希望就行动-歪长。此乃
生物本能。始知文竹及竹子皆无风骨。凡有风骨者皆得光无望者。笑别人乃酸葡萄之心态。
如得光有望，其表现会更加恐怖。没有约束可怕！

今日读文方知鲁迅家学渊博。其祖父乃举人进士。做过县令。官至翰林。因归乡陷于舞弊案
监斩侯。十二年方出狱。其母姓鲁，本姓周。为长子长孙。留学日本。寿仅五十五，因肺病
而逝。葬礼极其隆，文化及政要云集，几十万人为之送行。其真正精华文章末刊发。如《死》
等。

今日早归途中思觉悟一词极妙。世之十之一二乃稍有觉悟。即精英、权贵。此类人多为先觉
悟后发达。有从自然科学觉悟者，一如马化腾、雷军；有从人文觉悟者，马云、王健林、任
正非。何为觉？外界及社会敏感，断之准。何为悟，思之如何做，成败得失。始终前行，二
十年达惊人之境，令熟知之人嘡目结舌！

[[https://blog.csdn.net/yo746862873/article/details/52586339org-mode: 最好的文档编辑利器，没有之一]]
org-mode: 最好的文档编辑利器，没有之一

尽管按照 org-mode 官方 的说法，Org 是一个基于快速高效的文本方式来实现做笔记、管理待办事项（TODO list）以及做项目计划的模式（Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system ），但 Org-mode 首先是最好的文档编辑利器，没有之一。

我之前用过很多年 M$ Word, 也尝试过 OpenOffice/LibreOffice Writer,以及 iWorks Pager，但都不理想，写文档是没有痛快淋漓的感觉。直到后来发现了 Omni Outliner , 才终于找到了写作的乐趣。 但是了解了 org-mode 之后，发现原来一切都是浮云。只有 Org-mode 才是终极的解决之道。 使用 org-mode 写文档的时候，你只需要关注内容本身，而不需要写上几个字，选中它们按 Ctl-B，或者停下来用鼠标去点击“标题 1”，更甚觉得那个标题格式不顺眼，开始去调整样式，而停下写作的思路。

BTW，Omni Outliner 似乎也是从 Org-mode 找到的灵感，有图为证：



其功能与 Org-mode 几乎一样，而且这货居然支持 emacs 快捷键！

尽管 Omni Outliner 以 GUI 的方式实现了 org-mode 的功能，但是并不是很理想：它的内容是“所见即所得”的，很多时候你难以更改其样式，而且只能在 Mac OS 下使用。 而 Org-mode 使用文本方式，具有如下优势：

格式通用，系统无关，软件无关
体积小，速度快
“所想即所得”,比“所见即所得”更人性化
可以说，正是由于有了 Org-Mode， Emacs 处理文本的能力才得到了大幅度的提高，使得 Emacs 能够被非程序员接受。 如果说 LaTex 是排版的终极，那么 Org-mode 就是编辑的终极。Emacs 22 以后的版本已经集成了 org-mode，打开 .org 扩展的文件会自动进入 org 模式。此外，Vim 下面也有了对应的 Org-mode。

本文介绍最基本的编辑、格式化文本以及导出功能，后续再讨论高级玩法。

**** 书法人：深沉、儒雅、睿智、温暖！ 
2019-06-28 05:58


真正搞书法的人，是稳健练达的。他未必玉树临风，可眉宇间的深沉，言谈时的睿智，会给人以塌实硬朗的感觉，会让人莫名的信赖，会让人不自觉的依恋。因为勤于书写，相对来说，他们身上少些世俗，多些沉稳。表面上的正气凛然让人畏惧，可心底的那份儿女情长却在不经意中感染、温暖他人。



真正搞书法的人，是儒雅温厚的。习惯写字的人都明白：书写是一个过程，需要的不仅是时间，更需要心情。试想，一个整天疲于奔波，性情暴躁的男人，哪有闲情书写？即便有着创作的欲望，也未必能静心描摹；即使有了时间，也未必能书写出那种感人肺腑的篇章。



真正搞书法的人，是才思敏捷的。他未必能成名成家，可长久以来对文字的那份执著，超然出独特的魅力。静静地阅读，那深邃凝练的文思里，尽现着豪放的情怀；悠悠地回想，那神韵飞扬的诗行间，流露了浪漫的情思；脉脉地吟咏，那惟美幽婉的旋律中，缱绻出细腻的情致。



真正搞书法的人，是善于思想的。他未必学识特别渊博，却习惯在阅读中感悟，在寂静中思想，在回眸中提升。凝望，他从容的神态中显示出丰厚的阅历；聆听，他坚定的步履下沉淀出悠远的底蕴；沉湎，他行云流水的文思中涌动出桀骜不逊的刚强。



真正搞书法的人，是富有情趣的。他未必能耐得住寂寞，却会专注地面对瞬间的美丽。因为细致，静止的画面能在他的笔端鲜活起来；因为敏锐，沉寂的心绪能在他的指尖灵动起来；因为诚挚，刹那的芬芳也可挥洒出缤纷的画卷。



真正搞书法的人， 是懂得珍惜的。他未必有多么辉煌的事业，却有很好的文字功底。他可能会忽略名利，但绝不会淡漠对文字的情钟。文字与他是亲密的爱人，容不得疏忽；文字与他是灵犀的知己，来不得敷衍；文字与他是至爱的宝贝，舍不得含糊。



人们常喜欢把男人比做茶。茶的种类繁多，但喜欢写字的男人应该是茶中的精品，闲暇时静静品赏；疲惫时默默回味；沉浸在茶色中，任温暖在掌心传递，任馨香在唇齿萦绕，任甘甜在心尖溢开---该是怎样的悠然呢！

**** 读懂这十段《书论》，胜过你读的所有书！ 
2019-06-22 05:58

***** 李斯·用笔法

夫用笔之法，先急回，回疾下；如鹰望鹏逝，信之自然，不得重改。送脚，若游鱼得水；舞笔，如景山兴云。或卷或舒、乍轻乍重，善深思之，理当自见矣。



｜ 2 ｜

***** 赵壹·非草书

余郡士有梁孔达、姜孟颖者，皆当世之彦哲也，然慕张生之草书过于希孔、颜焉。孔达写书以示孟颖，皆口诵其文，手楷其篇，无怠倦焉。于是后学之徒竞慕二贤，守令作篇，人撰一卷，以为秘玩。余惧其背经而趋俗，此非所以弘道兴世也;又想罗、赵之所见嗤沮，故为说草书本末，以慰罗、赵、息梁、姜焉。



｜ 3 ｜

***** 崔瑗·草书势

书契之兴，始自颉皇;写彼鸟迹，以定文章。爰暨末叶、典籍弥繁;时之多僻，政之多权。官事荒芜，勦其墨翰;惟多佐隶，旧字是删。草书之法，盖又简略;应时谕指，用于卒迫。兼功并用，爱日省力;纯俭之变，岂必古式。观其法象，俯仰有仪;方不中矩，圆不中规。抑左扬右，望之若欹。兽跂鸟跱，志在飞移;狡兔暴骇，将奔未驰。或□□点□，状似连珠;绝而不离。畜怒怫郁，放逸后奇。或凌邃惴栗，若据高临危，旁点邪附，似螳螂而抱枝。绝笔收势，馀綖纠结;若山蜂施毒，看隙缘巇;腾蛇赴穴，头没尾垂。是故远而望之，漼焉若注岸奔涯;就而察之，一画不可移。几微要妙，临时从宜。略举大较，仿佛若斯。



｜ 4 ｜

***** 许慎·说文解字序

古者包羲氏之王天下也，仰则观象于天，俯则观法于地，视鸟兽之文与地之宜，近取诸身，于是始作《易》八卦，以垂宪象。及神农氏结绳为治而统其事，庶业其繁，饰伪萌生。黄帝之史仓颉，见鸟兽蹄迒之迹，知分理之可相别异也，初造书契。“百工以乂，万品以察，盖取诸夬”;“夬扬于王庭”。言文者宣教明化于王者朝廷，君子所以施禄及下，居德则忌也。仓颉之初作书，盖依类象形，故谓之文。其后形声相益，即谓之字。文者，物象之本;字者，言孳乳而浸多也。著于竹帛谓之书，书者如也。以迄五帝三王之世，改易殊体。封于泰山者七有二代，靡有同焉。

***** 蔡邕·九势

夫书肇于自然，自然既立，阴阳生矣，阴阳既生，形势出矣。藏头护尾，国在其中，下笔用力，肌肤之丽。故曰：势来不可止，势去不可遏，惟笔软则奇怪生焉。凡落笔结字，上皆覆下，下以承上，使其形势递相映带，无使势背。

转笔，宜左右回顾，无使节目孤露。

藏锋，点画出入之迹，欲左先右，至回左亦尔。

藏头，圆笔属纸，令笔心常在点画中行。

护尾，画点势尽，力收之。

疾势，出于啄磔之中，又在竖笔紧趯之内。

掠笔，在于趱锋峻趯用之。

涩势，在于紧駃战行之法。

横鳞，竖勒之规。

此名九势，得之虽无师授，亦能妙合古人。须翰墨功多，即造妙境耳。



｜ 6 ｜

***** 钟繇·用笔法

魏钟繇少时，随刘胜入抱犊山学书三年，还与太祖、邯郸淳、韦诞、孙子荆、关枇杷等议用笔法。繇忽见蔡伯喈笔法于韦诞坐上，自捶胸三日，其胸尽青，因呕血。太祖以五灵丹救之，乃活。繇苦求不与。及诞死，繇阴令人盗开其墓，遂得之，故知多力丰筋者圣，无力无筋者病，一一从其消息而用之，由是更妙。

繇曰：“岂知用笔而为佳也。故用笔者天也，流美者地也。非凡庸所知。”临死，乃从囊中出以授其子会，谕曰：“吾精思学书三十年，读他法未终尽，后学其用笔。若与人居，画地广数步，卧画被穿过表，如厕终日忘归。每见万类，皆画象之。”



｜ 7 ｜

***** 卫铄·笔阵图

夫三端之妙，莫先乎用笔;六艺之奥，莫重乎银钩。昔秦丞相斯所见周穆王书，七日兴叹，患其无骨。蔡尚书邕入鸿都观碣，十旬不返，嗟其出群。故知达其源者少，暗于理者多。

“一”[横] 如千里阵云，隐隐然其实有形。

“丶”[点] 如高峰坠石，磕磕然实如崩也。　

“丿”[撇] 陆断犀象。

“┐”[折] 百钧弩发。

“丨”[竖] 万岁枯滕。

“ㄟ”[捺] 崩浪雷奔。

[横折钩] 劲弩筋节。

右七条笔阵出人斩斫图。执笔有七种。有心急而执笔缓者，有心缓而执笔急者。若执笔近而不能紧者，心手不齐，意后笔前者败;若执笔远而急，意前笔后者胜。又有六种用笔：结构圆备如篆法;飘扬洒落如章草;凶险可畏如八分;窃窕出入如飞白;耿介特立如鹤头;郁拔纵横如古隶。然心存委曲，每为一字，各象其形，斯造妙矣，书道毕矣。永和四年，上虞制记。

***** 王羲之·自论书

吾书比之钟、张当抗行，或谓过之，张草犹当雁行。张精熟过人，临池学书，池水尽墨，若吾耽之若此，未必谢之。后达解者，知其评之不虚。吾尽心精作亦久，寻诸旧书，惟钟、张故为绝伦，其馀为是小佳，不足在意。去此二贤，仆书次之。顷得书，意转深，点画之间皆有意，自有言所不尽。得其妙者，事事皆然。平南李式论君不谢。

***** 羊欣

臣僧虔启：昨奉敕，须古来能书人名。臣所知局狭，不辨广悉，辄条疏上呈羊欣所撰录一卷，寻索未得，续更呈闻。谨启。

秦丞相李斯，秦中车府令赵高，右二人善大篆。　秦狱吏程邈，善大篆。得罪始皇，囚于云阳狱，增减大篆体，去其繁复，始皇善之，出为御史，名书曰隶书。扶风曹喜。后汉人，不知其官。善篆、隶，篆小异李斯，见师一时。

陈留蔡邕。后汉左中郎将。善篆、隶，采斯、喜之法，真定《宣父碑》文犹传于世。篆者师焉。杜陵陈遵，后汉人，不知其官。善篆、隶，每书，一座皆惊，时人谓为“陈惊座”。

上谷王次仲，后汉人，作八分楷法。师宜官，后汉人，不知何许人、何官。能为大字方一丈，小字方寸千言。《耿球碑》是宜官书，甚是矜重。或空至酒家，先书其壁，观者云集，酒因大售。俟其饮足，削书而退。

安定梁鸽，后汉人，官至选部尚书。得师宜官法，魏武重之，常以鹄书悬帐中。宫殿题署多是鹄手也。陈留邯郸淳，为魏临淄侯文学。得次仲法，名在鹄后。毛弘，鹄弟子。今秘书八分，皆传弘法。又有左子邑，与淳小异。

京兆杜度为魏齐相，始有草名。

安平崔瑗，后汉济北相，亦善草书。平苻坚，得摹崔瑗书，王子敬云：“极似张伯英。”瑗子实，官至尚书，亦能草书。

张农张芝，高尚不仕。善草书，精劲绝伦。家之衣帛，必先书而后练;临池学书，池水尽墨。每书，云“匆匆不暇草书”。人谓为“草圣”。芝弟昶，汉黄门侍郎，亦能草，今世云芝草者。多是昶作也。

姜诩、梁宣、田彦和及司徒韦诞，皆英弟子，并善草，诞书最优。诞字仲将，京兆人，善楷书，汉魏宫馆宝器，皆是诞亲手写。魏明帝起凌云台，误先钉榜而未题，以笼子盛诞，辘轳长口引之，使就榜书之。榜去地二十五丈，诞甚危惧。乃掷其笔，比下焚之。乃诫子孙，绝此楷法，著之家令。官至鸿胪少卿。诞子少季，亦有能称。

罗晖、赵袭，不详何许人，与伯英同时，见称西州，而矜许自与，众颇惑之。伯英与朱宽书，自叙云：“上比崔、杜不足，下方罗、赵有馀。”

河间张超亦善草，不及崔、张。

刘德升善为行书，不详何许人。

颖川钟繇，魏太尉;同郡胡昭，公车征。二子俱学于德升，而胡书肥，钟书瘦。钟有三体：一曰铭石之书，最妙者也;二曰章程书，传秘书、教小学者 也;三曰行押书，相闻者也。三法皆世人所善。繇子会，镇西将军。绝能学父书，改易邓艾上事，皆莫有知者。

河东卫觊，字伯儒，魏尚书仆射，善草及古文，略尽其妙。草体微瘦，而笔迹精熟。觊子瓘，字伯玉，为晋太保。采张芝法，以觊法参之，更为草藁。 草藁是相闻书也。瓘子恒，亦善书，博识古文。 敦煌索靖，字幼安，张芝姊之孙，晋征南司马，亦善草书。陈国何元公，亦善草书。

吴人皇象，能草，世称“沉著痛快”。

荥阳陈畅，晋秘书令史，善八分，晋宫、观、城门，皆畅书也。荥阳杨肇，晋荆州刺史，善草隶。潘岳诔曰：“草隶兼善，尺牍必珍，足无綴行，手不释文，翰动若飞，纸落如云。”肇孙经，亦善草隶。

京兆杜畿，魏尚书仆射;子恕，东郡太守;孙预，荆州刺史：三世善草藁。

晋齐王攸，善草行书。

泰山羊忱，晋徐州刺史;羊固，晋临海太守：并善行书。

江夏李式，晋侍中，善写隶、草。弟定，子公府，能名同式。

晋中书郎李充母卫夫人，善钟法，王逸少之师。

琅邪王廙，晋平南将军，荆州刺史，能章楷，谨传钟法。

晋丞相王导，善藁、行。廙从兄也。

王恬，晋中将军，会稽内史，善隶书。导第二子也。

王洽，晋中书令、领军将军，众书通善，尤能隶、行。从兄羲之云：“弟书遂不减吾。”恬弟也。

王珉，晋中书令，善隶、行。洽少子也。

王羲之，晋右将军、会稽内史，博精群法，特善草隶。羊欣云：“古今莫二。”廙兄子也。

王献之，晋中书令，善隶、藁，骨势不及父，而媚趣过之。羲之第七子也。兄玄之、微之，兄子淳之，并善草、行。

王允之，卫军将军、会稽内史，亦善草、行。舒子也。

太原王濛，晋司徒左长史，能革、隶。子修，琅琊王文学。善隶、行，与羲之善，故殆穷其妙。早亡，未尽其美。子敬每省修书云：“咄咄逼人。”

王绥，晋冠军将军、会稽内史，善隶、行。

高平郗愔，晋司空、会稽内史。善章草，亦能隶。郗超，晋中书郎，亦善草。愔子也。

颖川庾亮，晋太尉，善草、行。庾翼，晋荆州刺史。善隶、行，时与羲之齐名。亮弟也。

陈郡谢安，晋太傅，善隶、行。

高阳许静民，镇军参军，善隶、草，羲之高足。

晋穆帝时，有张翼善学人书，写羲之表，表出，经日不觉，后云：“几欲乱真。”。

会稽隐士谢敷，胡人康昕，并攻隶、草。

飞白本是宫殿题八分之轻者，全用楷法。吴时张弘好学不仕，常著乌巾，时人号为“张乌巾”。此人特善飞白，能书者鲜不好之。

***** 索靖·草书状

圣皇御世，随时之宜，仓颉既生，书契是为。

科斗鸟篆，类物象形，睿哲变通，意巧滋生。

损之隶草，以崇简易，百官毕修，事业并丽。

盖草书之为状也，婉若银钩，漂若惊鸾，舒翼未发，若举复安。

虫蛇虬蟉，或往或还，类婀娜以羸羸，欻奋□而桓桓。

及其逸游盼向，乍正乍邪，骐骥暴怒逼其辔，海水窳窿扬其波。

芝草葡陶还相继，棠棣融融载其华;玄熊对踞于山岳，飞燕相追而差池。

举而察之，以似乎和风吹林，偃草扇树，枝条顺气，转相比附，窃娆廉苫，随体散布。

纷扰扰以猗，靡中持疑而犹豫。玄螭狡兽嬉其间，腾猿飞鼬相奔趣。

凌鱼奋尾，骇龙反据，投空自窜，张设牙距。

或者登高望其类，或若既往而中顾，或若俶傥而不群，或若自检于常度。

于是多才之英，笃艺之彦，役心精微，耽此文宪。

守道兼权，触类生变，离析八体，靡形不判。

去繁存微，大象未乱，上理开元，下周谨案。

骋辞放手，雨行冰散，高间翰厉，溢越流漫。

忽班班成章，信奇妙之焕烂，体磥落而壮丽，姿光润以粲粲。

命杜度运其指，使伯英回其腕，著绝势于纨素，垂百世之殊观。

成公绥·隶书体

皇颉作文，因物构思;观彼鸟迹，遂成文字。灿矣成章，阅之后嗣，存在道德，纪纲万事。俗所传述，实由书纪;时变巧易，古今各异。虫篆既繁，草藁近伪;适之中庸，莫尚于隶。规矩有则，用之简易。

随便适宜，亦有弛张。操笔假墨，抵押毫芒。彪焕□硌，形体抑扬。芬葩连属，分间罗行。烂若天文布曜，蔚若锦绣之有章。

或轻拂徐振，缓按急挑。挽横引纵，左牵右绕。长波郁拂，微势缥缈。工巧难传，善之者少；应心隐手，必由意晓。

尔乃动纤指，举弱腕，握素纨，染玄翰。彤管电流，雨下雹散。点□折拨，掣挫安按。缤纷络绎，纷华灿烂。絪緼卓荦，一何壮观!繁缛成文，又何可玩!章周道之郁郁，表唐虞之耀焕。

若乃八分玺法，殊好异制；分白赋黑，棋布星列。翘首举尾，直刺邪制；缱绻结体，劖衫夺节。

或若虬龙盘游，蜿蜒轩翥；鸾凤翱翔，矫翼欲去。或若鸷鸟将击，并体抑怒，良马腾骧，奔放向路。仰而望之，郁若宵雾朝升；游烟连云；俯而察之，漂若清风厉水，漪澜成文。

重象表式，有模有概;形功难详，粗举大体

**** 笔之功用 
学习必用笔书写，否则白浪费纸墨及时间。所以有的人看似勤奋，实则没有进步。核心能力
不升反降。吾有四五年假学，水平未升，与不书写有直接关系。书写宜慢，古人以毛笔书，
慢而习之有效。赋文作诗皆精品，乃深思熟虑之作。因匆忙、了草作不得文章。今小学改用
铅笔，亦有此效。铅笔之性类毛笔，书写之功效同。一必慢，快则不成。二必匀力，否则断
而废。三则必静坐沉稳，方能认真完成每日作业。其实毛笔达到的效果更佳，不过难度稍大。
古人以此界择人。不会书者，不入学堂；不善书者禁入官场；书不美者难入朝堂。可以言，
以书定人。书为文人首务，可见其要。现误以为计算机高效，快而多，实则低而为垃圾文档。
茅盾一生以毛笔书写，上千万文稿。陈忠和白鹿塬历时四年手书而成，乃心血凝聚，才有深
度及韵味。文章不在长，三四百字一篇足矣。明事达意即可，便于他人阅读。三四千字垃圾
文，浪费纸墨。白话文其害大于功。有些人明白也不行或反道而行，识字弊大于利。古人以
书定界，不正之人难入仕途，危害自无。今无良文人、娱记为食而作，不论质量，只衡金钱。
此类垃圾危害甚大。人从小学生始，所用之笔铅笔、钢笔、签字笔渐变，书速渐提，由沉稳
变得快而飘浮，由认真到了草，由书写到速阅，快则快了，忘的也快了。学习无效了，久而
久之，以为年龄大了之故，放弃了。人之性情也从纯真、叛逆、疑惑、放纵渐变，工作生活
后悲观，一路变化，笔及书写方式亦随变也。要改之，则从书写及用具始，拿起毛笔，慢而
有效书写，多一分沉稳，多一分思考，凝聚一点精华，于己、于家、于人皆大有益也。

此文毛笔书一遍，录入改写一次，因误操作删除，此为第二次录改。觉不如第二次文。因此
非三思而行，两思即可，精华在二。多者烦了，产草。

**** 日记 
今日思把每天所书输入成文，以便于检索回顾。

早四点即起。昨上午游经石峪。静坐高岗听风，俯视芸芸众生。心涌诗意感怀，不论平仄格
律（？）。打字九十九点六（32 课）跟读一册 57 课两次，朗读三遍。录入课文，抄写一遍。
昨日购一老花镜，清楚又舒服。原来从德国购之可能为假货。国人把假货铺满世界，极大地
损害了中国形象。社会只管好坏人即可，好人不用管理。现正好反了，坏人天天想违规、钻
空子，处处得不当之利，习以为常。一般人按规矩办事反而不行，只能使人变坏。

今日感悟：

把诗词录入成文，以便检索
李渔之书常读，格律养成。

**** 今日偶思 
一个好干部基本素质：
不欺老实人：有德，有德之人方长久，走得远，位才有能高。
保护实干之人：正直，心正方能克邪祟，位子方能稳固。
提拔能力强之人：明理，能干事，干成事，出成绩，方可上升。
防控聪明人：眼明，不糊涂，不让人出漏了，出大事。（因为聪明人见利上，见缝钻，不顾
他人，包括领导）。
尊重智慧之人：此类人世事洞明，俯观齐鲁，熟知天下，心有人类，凝思宇宙。能力超群而
不显，做事于先人不解，不争名利衣食精，风清云淡永远闲。跳出世俗圈，不在红尘中。对
此类人依常规即可，重用不出力，打击己先亡。暂隐此处是缘份，不可强用断胞情。
不跟无德之人，不长，必走不远。
不攀势利之人，只降不升
紧随有德正直能力强之人，必有大就护周全。

收效不大，水平未升。关键在于未书写。一看会，一放忘，不会也。成人此病皆有，过于自
信而不知。初中及高中学生中下游之生多有此病，致常怀疑老师不公。自己明明皆会，为何
不对，考低分？！实则皆不会也。何为会？小学三年级前听说读写背无一误，此为真会，终
身不忘。此后，一般学生轻视不认真了，任何阶段习之标准不变：乃百分百也。不考一百，
不妄言会，九十分以下仅及格也。真会有两标准：一为会做，二为不失误。当有不会之题时已非学
霸。当考不了百分已至本人极限。不服不行。成人可以时间为代价习之皆百分百，久之可返
小学三年级之态，在校学生无时间也。渐落渐低。

今日思为何以毛笔书写？如为书好，美其名日书法！当每日临摹，拘谨而书，法不得，进步
慢，人无乐即弃。所以习书法九成自弃，鲜有成功者。仅有极爱之人，一生不缀，亦有大进
者，但不得头奖，不卖一文，其用何显？随迷失了自己，家人亦评之。又有九成之人心恢心，
终不得大道。

所有人忽视毛笔书写的核心功用而追其表也。

以毛笔书，一必认真，习有所获；二不能快，书与思同步，记忆极佳。此与小学生用铅笔、
田字格纸同效。所以三年级前皆双百，即此因。另不贪多，习一得一。成人习过即忘，乃贪
所致也。三以毛笔书，悟真理也。书有阴阳不可反，亦具韵律促协调，常书使人知进退，勿
违自然追美艳。文人一生以笔为具，以文抒怀，书为自用，他人不识。不愿他人评头足，何
须书得与人同，每字皆表豪放态，切勿拘谨让人批。胸中充满儒雅气，衣冠不整亦风正。一
身立功立言志，凝望星空思玉宇。

**** 日记 
早五点起。天气闷热，潮湿。打字（29 课）九十九点六，很熟之感。失误为手上功夫。朗读
4 遍，跟读两遍，录入一遍，默写一遍。全对，优！学习的唯一动力乃会的乐趣，非其他！
必须的条件相反不能长久。学习必须的几个环节中，听、说、读、写、背，吾感背最难，因
其速度快，所以小学皆要求背诵。且背过、背熟。学习成效最显著的是书写，特别是认真慢
书，小学生以铅笔书写作业即此意。今吾以毛笔代之更佳。现吾明白：国人文明灿烂，与古
贤书写工具有极大关系。凡有所成就者，书写极认真。钱学森九十岁仍以铅笔认真在稿纸上
书写。吾当闻道而行。

今早五点四十返家，送孩子返济。回办公室后继续学习。肚子饿的很。
录入完笔记，书写 30 课英语。

**** 极认真地书写英语， 
一小时一刻钟，背痛。但自感一字未错。语言学习必经历小学五年阶段。一字不错，且要双
百。只有对与错，即一百则会，九十九为零。所以学习英语没有打好基础，永远为外语，不
是母语。只有当母语学习，才能体会英语的真意，才能欣赏其文化精华。才能得心应手的作
为工具使用。否则为考试英语，考多少分没用。且从人之成就看，一般决定于小学，小学双
百才有可能有点小成就，初中正常情况下才有可能前一二名，高中有前十有潜力。所以英语
最简单的阶段反而最重要，很多人忽略了此，认为越难越好，差矣。大道丟简。

早四点半起。打字 99.9%（27 课），26 课 98.2%。跟读三朗读二录一抄一。今日书有米芾刷之
意。书之核心乃笔法，而非形质。会用笔，熟知笔性，顺其性，执运舒服、合理。古贤已对
毛笔之性摸透，今人习之即可。勿自创新法。吾习书四载，尚不精执运。此须悟，非勤所达
也。人可描形，但势不可绘。必在书中自成，非人描画。

今日四点起。打字 98.7%，再次 99.5%。跟读四，朗读一、录一默一。昨日中午薛院长等一聚
。饮酒不少。下午盹睡。近来太乏，事毕须彻底休整。一张一驰，文武之道。勿拿生命博名
利。史上有许多人乃生命绽放。有杰出者三十而逝，中庸之道极有道理。996 乃拿人才之命
换发展。认真读书，一丝不拘。书写乃养生之道。

早响铃方起。打字 99.2%。跟读二、朗读二，录入查词。默一。昨日济南一行，极累。晚友
志坐至十点多。近来渐成习惯，一日不完成功课便不适。人有各种需求，学习为其一。从其
得乐，与己较进步，与人较生气。境界异，视野不同。立于楼下人低头，身居极顶俯众生。
心静方可思周全，人气失据妄生烦。

日，生命意义在何？一为强己，二为家庭，再者立功、立德、立言。一切以乐为基。舍此，
无以为继。人有七情六欲，身体之觉易得，而失快。灵魂之愉难及但久。饮食男女少及灵魂，
多为衣食住行。只胡对此追求理性化之士有可能跃升为此境。继往圣绝学。

厚。时光如梭。珍惜之，勿违自然。学习之功，非几日，而在于坚持。非为考试，也非为他
人评。而为与已较。人之至高境界乃超凡脱俗。勿与人比。每日体已之进步，乃大乐也。衣

**** 补录日记

早五点起，打字九十九点三。

朗读三课，新概念一册倒序学习一遍。自感不牢固，至少三遍方可。

人不可贪快。母语国家儿童五年习听说。上小学方始书写。对于英语，外籍人士未有此听说
训练，所以学习英语难很正常。如不历此程，永不真正入门。不知真会英语是何感觉，不体
语言之趣。如此学习何乐之有，何益之有？用之不顺，久而遗忘。此为不会也！乃考试英语
也。

学任何新知识，应如小学生一般。认真、重复、慢而牢固、一丝不拘。此能力乃人一生之核
心能力。此谓童子功，日后难以追赶。他人永不可及。大道至简，没有人会重做小学生，最
易之事最难坚持。

所以要学好英语，必须做五年加四年（学前）儿童，听说读写背。缺一不可，快了不可。

书法亦如此，必须沉心静气，习练童子功。

**** 日记 
7:50 上班后整理办公室，历时 25 分钟。出一身汗。

整洁的办公环境提升工作效率，心情舒畅。也反映了一个人当前的风茂。

今日又思把每天日记录入以便于总结思考。Jist Do It。

昨晚办公室谈工作至十点半。休息时十点半。

早五点四十方起。打字二十六课九十九点七。跟读 1、3、5 三课，发音逐步纠正。录入及默
写此三课。只有录入及默写才能检查是否真对。

学习不贪多，慢即快，人习之根本动力乃乐趣，此乃人之天性。愉悦生于会及不犯错带来的
成就感。所以习必真会方达标。为何有误而现差异？乃自认为会，一看懂，一放忘，非真会
也。唯小学生三年级之前考双百，此乃真会，终生不忘。达此，必认真。无他法。捷径乃弯
路。

How do you do？生人问候，不回答。人名乃难点。一如国人，人名万不可写错，此乃大忌。
永不可原谅。如不会写时，可问本人，更显人名有文化，更加易于拉近距离。感冒乃冷热风
寒，仍重。昨日八点即歇。人累极易病，勿太拼。中庸之道很科学。人之欲达五成即可。事
