老外常说的 excuse me 这 7 种用法你会吗？

2018-12-17  wqhr   阅 3766  转 7
在澳洲生活的一代移民们，在刚刚抵达这片土地的时候，由于文化背景差异和语言受限等问题，经常会领会错意思，做出词不达意表述。甚至产生很多误解和误会的情况。

对于刚进入一个陌生环境的人来说，模仿周围的人的言行举止，是最快融入群体的方式之一。
所以，大家会将澳洲人的口头禅之一“I am so sorry”或者单纯的一个“sorry”挂在嘴边。有事儿没事儿，大事儿小事儿的都要说一下。
最后变成了，
“借过”成了“sorry”，
“刮碰”成了“sorry”,
“挤车”成了“sorry”，
“打喷嚏”都成了“sorry”

但是，说顺口的这句“sorry”在很多时候，并不适合。
比如，没听清楚对方的表达，完全没必要用“sorry”这种明显抱有歉意的词汇。
完全可以用 excuse me 或者 pardon 来代替。
有小伙伴问了，excuse me 跟 sorry 差不多啊，都是抱歉的意思。
但实际情况是，sorry 或者 i am sorry 的语气更重，代表了自己存在很大过错，向对方诚恳的认错

所以说，Sorry 不能随便说
为什么呢？
发生碰撞时，如果你先说了 Sorry，代表了你心里认定，这次的碰撞是由于你的过错而产生的，哪怕你只是一句口头禅。
尤其是遇到一些有着种族主义的澳洲人时，情况更加闹心。
因为这些人天生有着一种常人难以理解的优越感。哪怕自己有错，在面对非澳洲人种时，也会觉得自己没错。
在和这种人发生了纠纷的时候，你先说 Sorry，他们就会顺杆子往上爬，完全不承认自己有一丁点错误。
这个时候，你的一句口头禅，就会让你糟心很久。
还有，更重要的一点，在发生了交通事故的时候，不论哪种情况，千万不能下车就说“Sorry”。

在这种情况，谁说 Sorry 就代表谁承认自己负全责。
在这种情况，第一时间叫警察，在警察到来后，实事求是的阐述一遍事情发生的经过和现场情况。让警察来判断事故责任。

有风度，讲礼貌，不代表先说 Sorry，要根据不同的场合，不同的情况，自己是否真的犯有错误来判定应该采用的单词和句子。
“Sorry”可以说，但只有在自己犯了错的情况下，才适合使用。
作为天朝子民，哪有没事儿就跟人说对不起的啊~
各位小伙伴千万要牢记哦！

老外常说的 excuse me 这 7 种用法你会吗？

文章摘要：
说起 excuseme 应该没有童鞋说不认识，但是除了最早学到的“打扰一下”，你知道 excuseme 还可以用在哪些情境中吗？看完本文你就知道它究竟是怎么用的。

大家有没有注意到 excuse me 这个短语在日常会话中的使用频率非常高？在不同语境中使用 excuse me,甚至使用不同的语调来读 excuse me 都可以表示不同的含义。今天的日常英语口语就跟大家聊聊 excuse me 的不同用法。

老外常说的 excuse me 这 7 种用法你会吗？.jpg

1.对自己的失礼之处表示歉意，比如在餐桌上打了个喷嚏，这时的 excuse me 表示“对不起，抱歉”，和 sorry 同义。

eg: The girl said “excuse me” immediately when she ran into me.

这个女孩撞到我的时候马上说了句“对不起”。



2.在聚会、会议等场合突然有事需要中途短暂离开，比如开会的时候需要出去接个电话时可以说 excuse me,表示“失陪一下”。

eg: Excuse me, I have to answer an important call.

失陪，我得去接个重要的电话。



3.excuse me 最常见的用法是表示“劳驾，打扰一下”，通常在向陌生人求助的时候使用。

eg: Excuse me, can you tell me where is the nearest bank?

打扰一下，你能告诉我最近的银行在哪儿吗？



4.对某事有异议，想要插话的时候也可以说 excuse me,表示“抱歉，打断一下”。

eg: Excuse me, I’m afraid that you made some mistakes.

抱歉，你好像弄错了些事情。



5.没听清对方说的话，想要对方再说一遍的时候也可以用 excuse me,注意此时要用疑问句的语气，表示“你说什么”。

eg: Excuse me? I didn’t hear you clearly.

你说什么？我没听清你说的话。



6.对对方所说的话表示惊讶或者不敢相信的时候也可以用 excuse me,表示“真的吗？你不是在开玩笑吧？”之类的意思,同样是疑问的语气。

eg: Excuse me? You just said that Judy resigned?

你是在开玩笑吧？你刚刚说朱迪辞职了？



7.经过别人的旁边的时候有可以说 excuse me,表示“借过，劳驾”。

eg: Excuse me, can I get past?

劳驾，让我过去可以吗?



excuse me 这些用法是不是很实用？下次遇到以上这些情景 excuse me 就可以派上用场了。
