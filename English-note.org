 Neck

 The neck is the part of the body, on many terrestrial or secondarily aquatic vertebrates, that distinguishes the head from the torso or trunk. The adjective (from Latin) signifying "of the neck" is cervical (though in non-technical contexts, this is more frequently used to describe the cervix).

 Literate

 Literacy is traditionally understood as the ability to read and write. The term's meaning has been expanded to include the ability to use language, numbers, images and other means to understand and use the dominant symbol systems of a culture. The concept of literacy is expanding in OECD countries to include skills to access knowledge through technology and ability to assess complex contexts.Literacy represents the lifelong, intellectual process of gaining meaning from a critical interpretation of written or printed text. The key to all literacy is reading development, a progression of skills that begins with the ability to understand spoken words and decode written words, and culminates in the deep understanding of text. Reading development involves a range of complex language underpinnings including awareness of speech sounds (phonology), spelling patterns (orthography), word meaning (semantics), grammar (syntax) and patterns of word formation (morphology), all of which provide a necessary platform for reading fluency and comprehension. Once these skills are acquired, the reader can attain full language literacy, which includes the abilities to apply to printed material critical analysis, inference and synthesis; to write with accuracy and coherence; and to use information and insights from text as the basis for informed decisions and creative thought. The inability to do so is called illiteracy or analphabetism.The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines literacy as the "ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute, using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in their community and wider society".

credit card
N-COUNT A credit card is a plastic card that you use to buy goods on credit. Compare . 信用卡
A credit card is a payment card issued to users as a system of payment. It
allows the cardholder to pay for goods and services based on the holder's
promise to pay for them. The issuer of the card creates a revolving account and
grants a line of credit to the consumer (or the user) from which the user can
borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance to the user.A credit
card is different from a charge card: a charge card requires the balance to be
paid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a
continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. A credit card
also differs from a cash card, which can be used like currency by the owner of
the card. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card
typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed
by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a
later date.The size of most credit cards is 3 3⁄8 × 2 1⁄8 in (85.60 × 53.98
mm), conforming to the ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 standard. Credit cards have a printed
or embossed bank card number complying with the ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard.
Both of these standards are maintained and further developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC
17/WG 1. Before magnetic stripe readers came into widespread use, plastic credit
cards issued by many department stores were produced on stock ("Princess" or
"CR-50") slightly longer and narrower than 7810.
