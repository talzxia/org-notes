* Lesson 85

Hello, Ken.

Hi, George.

Have you just been to the cinema?

Yes, I have.

What's on?

'Pairs in the spring.'

Oh, I've already seen it.

I saw it on television last year.

It's an old film, but it's very good.

Pairs is a beautiful city.

I've never been there.

Have you ever been there, Ken? 

Yes, I have. I was there in spring. 

Pairs in the spring, eh?

It was spring,

but the weather was awful.

It rained all the time.

Just like London! 


* lesson 87
/Is/ my car ready yet?

I don't know, sir.

What's the number of your car?

It is neighbour.

He's a very nice person.

We'll all miss him.

When will the new people move into this house?

I think that they'll move in the day after tomorrow.

Will you see Ian today, Jenny?

Yes, I will.

Please give him my regards.

Poor Ian!

He didn't want to leave this house.

No, he didn't want to leave,

but his wife did.
