### 信用卡；记帐卡

credit card
N-COUNT A credit card is a plastic card that you use to buy goods on credit. Compare . 信用卡
A credit card is a payment card issued to users as a system of payment. It
allows the cardholder to pay for goods and services based on the holder's
promise to pay for them. The issuer of the card creates a revolving account and
grants a line of credit to the consumer (or the user) from which the user can
borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance to the user.A credit
card is different from a charge card: a charge card requires the balance to be
paid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a
continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. A credit card
also differs from a cash card, which can be used like currency by the owner of
the card. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card
typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed
by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a
later date.The size of most credit cards is 3 3⁄8 × 2 1⁄8 in (85.60 × 53.98
mm), conforming to the ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 standard. Credit cards have a printed
or embossed bank card number complying with the ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard.
Both of these standards are maintained and further developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC
17/WG 1. Before magnetic stripe readers came into widespread use, plastic credit
cards issued by many department stores were produced on stock ("Princess" or
"CR-50") slightly longer and narrower than 7810.

    School
    
    A school is an institution designed for the teaching of students (or "pupils")
    under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal
    education, which is commonly compulsory.[citation needed] In these systems,
    students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary
    by country (discussed in the Regional section below) but generally include
    primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have
    completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, is
    commonly called a university college or university.In addition to these core
    schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after
    primary and secondary education. Kindergarten or pre-school provide some
    schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5). University, vocational
    school, college or seminary may be available after secondary school. A school
    may also be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or
    a school of dance. Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and
    methods.There are also non-government schools, called private schools. Private
    schools may be required when the government does not supply adequate, or special
    education. Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian
    schools, hawzas, yeshivas, and others; or schools that have a higher standard of
    education or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for adults
    include institutions of corporate training, Military education and training and
    business schools.In homeschooling and online schools, teaching and learning take
    place outside of a traditional school building.

    Pupil
    
    The pupil is a hole located in the center of the iris of the eye that allows light to strike the retina. It appears black because light rays entering the pupil are either absorbed by the tissues inside the eye directly, or absorbed after diffuse reflections within the eye that mostly miss exiting the narrow pupil.In humans the pupil is round, but other species, such as some cats, have vertical slit pupils, goats have horizontally oriented pupils, and some catfish have annular types. In optical terms, the anatomical pupil is the eye's aperture and the iris is the aperture stop. The image of the pupil as seen from outside the eye is the entrance pupil, which does not exactly correspond to the location and size of the physical pupil because it is magnified by the cornea. On the inner edge lies a prominent structure, the collarette, marking the junction of the embryonic pupillary membrane covering the embryonic pupil.

    Student
    
    A student (also pupil) is a learner, or someone who attends an educational institution. In some nations, the English term (or its cognate in another language) is reserved for those who attend university, while a schoolchild under the age of eighteen is called a pupil in English (or an equivalent in other languages), although in the United States and in Australia a person enrolled in grades K–12 is often called a student. In its widest use, student is used for anyone who is learning, including mid-career adults who are taking vocational education or returning to university, or younger researchers or artists learning from a more experienced (and usually older) colleague and mentor.

Postman

A mail carrier, mailman, postal carrier, postman, postwoman (US),
postman/postwoman (UK), letter carrier (in American English) or postie (in
Australia, New Zealand, Scotland) is an employee of the post office or postal
service, who delivers mail and parcel post to residences and businesses. The
term "mail carrier" came to be used as a gender-neutral substitute for "mailman"
soon after women began performing the job. In the Royal Mail, the official name
changed from "letter carrier" to "postman" in 1883, and "postwoman" has also
been used for many years.[citation needed]

Envelop

Envelopment is the military tactic of seizing objectives in the enemy's rear
with the goal of destroying specific enemy forces and denying them the ability
to withdraw. Rather than attacking an enemy head-on as in a frontal assault an
envelopment seeks to exploit the enemy's flanks, attacking them from multiple
directions and avoiding where their defenses are strongest. A successful
envelopment lessens the number of casualties suffered by the attacker while
inducing a psychological shock on the defender and improving the chances to
destroy them. An envelopment will consist of one or more enveloping forces,
which attacks the enemy's flank(s), and a fixing force, which attacks the
enemy's front and "fixes" them in place so that they cannot withdraw or shift
their focus on the enveloping forces. While a successful tactic, there are risks
involved with performing an envelopment. The enveloping force can become
overextended and cut off from friendly forces by an enemy counterattack, or the
enemy can counterattack against the fixing force.According to the United States
Army there exist four types of envelopment:

    Envelop
    
    EnvelopShowment is the military tactic of seizing objectives in the enemy's rear
    with the goal of destroying specific enemy forces and denying them the ability
    to withdraw. Rather than attacking an enemy head-on as in a frontal assault an
    envelopment seeks to exploit the enemy's flanks, attacking them from multiple
    directions and avoiding where their defenses are strongest. A successful
    envelopment lessens the number of casualties suffered by the attacker while
    inducing a psychological shock on the defender and improving the chances to
    destroy them. An envelopment will consist of one or more enveloping forces,
    which attacks the enemy's flank(s), and a fixing force, which attacks the
    enemy's front and "fixes" them in place so that they cannot withdraw or shift
    their focus on the enveloping forces. While a successful tactic, there are risks
    involved with performing an envelopment. The enveloping force can become
    overextended and cut off from friendly forces by an enemy counterattack, or the
    enemy can counterattack against the fixing force.According to the United States
    Army there exist four types of envelopment:

    Literate
    
    Literacy is traditionally understood as the ability to read and write. The term's meaning has been expanded to include the ability to use language, numbers, images and other means to understand and use the dominant symbol systems of a culture. The concept of literacy is expanding in OECD countries to include skills to access knowledge through technology and ability to assess complex contexts.Literacy represents the lifelong, intellectual process of gaining meaning from a critical interpretation of written or printed text. The key to all literacy is reading development, a progression of skills that begins with the ability to understand spoken words and decode written words, and culminates in the deep understanding of text. Reading development involves a range of complex language underpinnings including awareness of speech sounds (phonology), spelling patterns (orthography), word meaning (semantics), grammar (syntax) and patterns of word formation (morphology), all of which provide a necessary platform for reading fluency and comprehension. Once these skills are acquired, the reader can attain full language literacy, which includes the abilities to apply to printed material critical analysis, inference and synthesis; to write with accuracy and coherence; and to use information and insights from text as the basis for informed decisions and creative thought. The inability to do so is called illiteracy or analphabetism.The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines literacy as the "ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute, using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in their community and wider society".
